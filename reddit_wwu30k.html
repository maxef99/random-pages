		<p>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">Public Notification of the land use for the ADA Elevator installation at the 168th St Station in accordance with 23 CFR 774.17 governing the</span>

		<h2>
			Description of 168th St Station in Manhattan
		</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">The 168th St Station of the IRT, Broadway-7th Ave Line was opened on April 14th, 1906. It is an underground New York City Subway station</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">complex serving the Broadway IRT Line (1 train) &#x2013; connections are also available to the IND 8th Ave Line (A, C trains).</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">MTA Construction & Development (C&D) proposes to make IRT portion of the 168th St Station Complex ADA compliant. The major purpose of</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">this project is to provide an accessible path to the 1 train as well as create an ADA compliant transfer between the 1 train and A/C trains.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="hyphenate">
				<span class="avoid-wrap">MTA C&D is planning to provide four (4) new elevators <b>One (1) street to upper mezzanine elevator, two (2) upper mezannine to north-</b></span>
				&shy;<span class="avoid-wrap"><b>bound platform elevators, and one (1) lower mezannine to southbound platform elevator)</b> to allow vertical access from street level to</span>
			</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">the station mezannine and from the mezannine to the station's two side platforms consistent with ADA requirements.</span>
		</p>
		<h2>
			Impact of Project to a Section 4(f) Resource
		</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">The 168th St Station ADA work will necessitate the use of a portion of Mitchel Square under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) located above the underground station which is considered a Section 4(f) resource. Section 4(f) of the U.S.</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">Department of Transportation Act of 1966 states that projects that receive funding or require approval by an agency of the U.S. DOT cannot</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">consider use of land from a significant publicly-owned park, recreation area, wildlife or waterfowl refuge, or any significant historic site for</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">transportation project development unless the following conditions apply:</span>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of the land; and</li>
			<li>The action includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the property resulting from use; or</li>
			<li>
				<span class="avoid-wrap">The use of the Section 4(f) property, including any measures(s) to minimize harm (such as any avoidance, minimization,</span>
				<span class="avoid-wrap">mitigation, or enhancement measures) will have a de minimis impact, as defined in 23 CFR ยง 774.17, on the property.</span>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">A <i>de minimis</i> impact involves the use of Section 4(f) property that is generally minor in nature. A de minimis impact is one that&#x2014;after</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">taking into account avoidance, minimiation, mitigation, and enhancement measures that are committed to by the applicant&#x2014;results in no</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">adverse effect to the activities, features, or attributes qualifying a park for protection under Section 4(f).</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">The project is located to the east of a mapped parkland, known as Mitchel Square. Mitchel Square is a triangular property, bounded by West</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">166th Street, Broadway, and Audubon Avenue. The visual centerpiece of Mitchel Square is the Washington Heights-Inwood War memorial, a</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">bronze and granite sculpture. Mitchel Square features several benches currently surrounded by trees and shrubbery. This parkland is a protected</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">property under Section 4(f) of the U.S. Department of Transportation Act, commonly referred to as Section 4(f).</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">Two below-grade elevators will be installed underground approximately 50 feet north of the Washington Heights-Inwood War Memorial.</span>
			<span class="hyphenate">
				<span class="avoid-wrap">These elevators and an adjacent new egress stair (east of the elevators) will provide vertical access from a new upper mezannine passage</span>
				&shy;<span class="avoid-wrap">way to the IRT northbound platform level (100 feet below grade). The elevators and the new egress stair will be installed in a shaft that will</span>
			</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">be excavated in the northeastern corner of Mitchel Square, from the street level, through rock to the depth of 100 feet below grade to reach</span>
			<span class="hyphenate">
				<span class="avoid-wrap">the platform level. The excavation will take place in in a planted area with shrubs and one tree. The construction staging area will be alien</span>
				&shy;<span class="avoid-wrap">ated temporarily for approximately 3 years and will occupy approximately 3000 square feet of Mitchel Square. Within that area, the exca</span>
				&shy;<span class="avoid-wrap">vation of the shaft would temporarily occupy approximately 1200 square feet (approximately 30 feet by 40 feet). Below the area of the</span>
			</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">excavation, the existing station roof must be modified (extended upward) to accomodate the elevator overrun, therefore a below grade</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">portion of the parkland will be permanently alienated for the raised station roof. After the excavation is completed and the construction is</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">finished, Mitchel Square will be restored to the existing conditions and its original use; no permanent above-grade structures will be added</span>
			<span class="avoid-wrap">to the parkland.</span>
